# boston_housing_knnr_project
This is a little project that I did to practice building a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) Regression model. The goal was to use the scikit-learn Boston housing data set to build a KNN Regression model that would predict median house values. I was able to build a KNN Regression model which had coefficient of determination of 0.888.

This project was done with Python 3.0 and Jupyter Notebook. I used the scikit-learn Boston housing data set, and utilized Pandas, Matplotlib, and the scikit-learn packages preprocessing, model_selection, linear_models, and neighbors in my analysis. So long as you have Jupyter Notebook and the named packages installed, the project should run on your machine. The project itself has been included as MAC_boston_housing_knn_regress.ipynb.
